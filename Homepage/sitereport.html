          In Madhab website, There are five page such as
          Homepage,Portfolio,Blog,Site Report and Contact page.I used many
          different types of HTML and CSS function in this website.Commonly,I
          used DIV,Span element for block and Grid and Flex for Layout, padding,
          margin properties.
        </p>
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <p>
          In homepage, there are a four section such as
          <strong>nav,main,section and footer</strong>. In
          <strong>nav</strong>section i used black background and for layout i
          applied flex. I alos add logo on the sise of
          <strong>nav</strong>.there is also toggle button for mobile version.
          In the main section i applied image and some text about me.i used the
          image from Uplash. It's a nice image. in this section i uesd grid
          layout.Then third part i applied 2 section of grid.one of the image
          section and one of the text.In the section i introduced myself.
          Lastly,you can see footer of this page.Footer is the very difficult
          part of homepage to make.I spend a lots of time for footer. in this
          footer i applied five grid.
        </p>
        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
          In this page, I described modules details. There are six modules. i
          applied in just one grid.I used <strong>Overlay</strong> in this
          page.In other words, it is used to set one thing on the top of
          another. The overlay makes a web-page attractive, and it is easy to
          design. Creating an overlay effect means to put two div together at
          the same place, but both will appear when required.
        </p>
        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <p>
          Blog is the one of the most interesting page. I present many different
          activities during my assignment. I display six main thing. In this
          page i used 3 columns and 2 rows grid. In this page i also used
          animation.
        </p>
        <h1>Contact</h1>
        <p>
          Contact page, Which is use to link with me if you want any
          help.Basically,I applied many different form for name,email,message
          box and etc.I alos display my location through the map.I applied grid
          in this page for layout.
